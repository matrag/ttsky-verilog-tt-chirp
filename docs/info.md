## How it works

This design will take as input a Byte from a UART  receive (RX) line and produce a chirp signal in output.
The Chirp is available as 8-bit digital bus (7 is MSB, 0 is LSB).
The produced chirp will be the digital rapresentation of the input Byte in LoRa - Style modulation at BW 125 kHz, SF8.



## How to test
Connect all Hardware.
Connect and enable the 10 MHz clock stimulus.
Power on: assert Reset input low.
Send a UART byte and observe the data output.

## External hardware

UART transceiver (TX only) -> connect to input RX
Clock generator --> connect to clock input (10 MHz clock)
Digital Signal Analyzer --> connect bit 7 down to 0 of output data
